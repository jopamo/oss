# Operating System Simulator (OSS)

## Overview

The Operating System Simulator (OSS) is designed to simulate an operating system's process scheduling and inter-process communication using shared memory. This simulation includes a "simulated system clock" and a process table consisting of Process Control Blocks (PCBs) for each process. The OSS manages launching worker processes (`worker`) with specific lifetimes and ensures synchronization using shared memory.

## Quick Start Guide ðŸš€

### Compile the Program

Compile both the `oss` and `worker` executables by running:

```bash
make
```

### Running the OSS Program

The `oss` program supports several command-line options to customize the simulation:

- `-n <total_processes>`: Set the total number of processes to spawn.
- `-s <simultaneous_processes>`: Set the maximum number of processes to run simultaneously.
- `-t <time_limit_for_children>`: Set the time limit (in seconds) for each child process's lifespan.
- `-i <interval_in_ms_to_launch_children>`: Set the interval (in milliseconds) between launching child processes.

**Example Command:**

To launch a simulation with 10 total processes, where no more than 5 processes are running simultaneously, each with a random lifespan between 1 to 7 seconds, and launching new processes every 100 milliseconds:

```bash
./oss -n 10 -s 5 -t 7 -i 100
```

### Worker Executable Instructions

The `worker` executable is launched by `oss` with two command-line arguments specifying its lifespan in seconds and nanoseconds. For example, `oss` might launch a `worker` like so (for internal operation demonstration only):

```bash
./worker 5 500000
```

**Note:** The `worker` executable is not intended to be executed directly by the user.

### Cleaning Up

To clean up and remove all compiled files, run:

```bash
make clean
```
