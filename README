# Process Manager (psmgmt)

## Overview

The Process Manager (psmgmt) is designed to simulate an operating system's process scheduling and inter-process communication using shared memory. This simulation includes a "simulated system clock" and a process table consisting of Process Control Blocks (PCBs) for each process. **The latest update introduces advanced resource management and deadlock detection mechanisms to psmgmt, enhancing its ability to simulate real-world operating system behaviors.**

## Quick Start Guide ðŸš€
LOG_LEVEL is controlled in src/globals.c, but this will soon be commandline option.

### Compile the Program

Compile both the `psmgmt` and `worker` executables by running:

```bash
make
```

### Running psmgmt

The `psmgmt` program supports several command-line options to customize the simulation:

- `-n <total_processes>`: Set the total number of processes to spawn.
- `-t <time_limit_for_children>`: Set the time limit (in seconds) for each child process's lifespan.
- `-i <interval_in_ms_to_launch_children>`: Set the interval (in milliseconds) between launching child processes.
- `-f <logfile>`: Specify the log file for `psmgmt` output.

**Example Command:**

To launch a simulation with the updated features:

```bash
./psmgmt -n 10 -t 7 -i 100 -f psmgmt_log.txt
```

### Cleaning Up

To clean up and remove all compiled files, run:

```bash
make clean
```
