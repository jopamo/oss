# Operating System Simulator (OSS)

## Quick Start Guide 🚀

### Compile the Program

Run the following command in the terminal to compile both the `oss` and `user` executables:

```
make
```

### Running the OSS Program

To start the `oss` program with custom parameters, use the following command structure:

```
./oss -n <total_processes> -s <simultaneous_processes> -t <iterations>
```

**Example:**

To launch 5 user processes, with no more than 3 running simultaneously, each performing 7 iterations, enter:

```
./oss -n 5 -s 3 -t 7
```

### Cleaning Up

To remove all compiled files, run:

```
make clean
```
